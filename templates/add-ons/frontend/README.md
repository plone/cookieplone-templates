Powered by [cookieplone](https://github.com/plone/cookieplone) and [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), [Cookieplone frontend add-on](https://github.com/plone/cookieplone-templates/tree/main/templates/add-ons/frontend) is intended to be used by Plone developers to create new add-on packages for Volto.

## Prerequisites

-   [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is the recommended tool for managing Python versions and project dependencies.
-   Node.js and pnpm: essential for managing and running JavaScript packages.


### uv

To install uv, use the following command, or visit the [uv installation page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for alternative methods.

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```


### Node.js and pnpm

Follow the [Plone documentation](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/install-from-packages.html#pre-requisites-for-installation) for detailed instructions.


## Generate your Plone add-on üéâ

```shell
uvx cookieplone frontend_addon
```


### Use options to avoid prompts

Cookieplone will ask a lot of questions, as described under [Project generation options](#project-generation-options).
You can use some of its options to avoid repeatedly entering the same values.


#### `--no-input`

You can use the [`--no-input`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli_options.html#cmdoption-cookiecutter-no-input) option to make cookieplone not prompt for parameters and only use `cookiecutter.json` file content.


#### `--replay` and `--replay-file`

You can use the option [`--replay-file`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli_options.html#cmdoption-cookiecutter-replay-file) to not prompt for parameters and only use information entered previously or from a specified file.
See [Replay Project Generation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/replay.html) in the cookiecutter documentation for more information.
