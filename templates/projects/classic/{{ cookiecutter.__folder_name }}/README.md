## Quick Start 🏁

### Prerequisites ✅

-   An [operating system](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#prerequisites-for-installation) that runs all the requirements mentioned.
-   [uv](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#uv)
-   [Make](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#make)
-   [Git](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#git)
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (optional)


### Installation 🔧

1.  Clone this repository, then change your working directory.

    ```shell
    git clone {{ cookiecutter.__repository_git }}.git
    cd {{ cookiecutter.__project_slug }}
    ```

2.  Install this code base.

    ```shell
    make install
    ```


### Fire Up the Servers 🔥

1.  Create a new Plone site on your first run.

    ```shell
    make backend-create-site
    ```

2.  Start the backend at http://localhost:8080/.

    ```shell
    make backend-start
    ```

Voila! Your Plone site should be live and kicking! 🎉

### Local Stack Deployment 📦

Deploy a local Docker Compose environment that includes the following.

- Docker image for Backend 🖼️
- A stack with a Traefik router and a PostgreSQL database 🗃️
- Accessible at [http://{{ cookiecutter.__project_slug }}.localhost](http://{{ cookiecutter.__project_slug }}.localhost) 🌐

Run the following commands in a shell session.

```shell
make stack-create-site
make stack-start
```

And... you're all set! Your Plone site is up and running locally! 🚀

## Project structure 🏗️

This monorepo consists of the following distinct sections:

- **backend**: Houses the API and Plone installation, utilizing pip instead of buildout, and includes a policy package named {{ cookiecutter.python_package_name }}.
- **devops**: Encompasses Docker stack, Ansible playbooks, and cache settings.
- **docs**: Scaffold for writing documentation for your project.

### Why this structure? 🤔

- All necessary codebases to run the site are contained within the repository (excluding existing add-ons for Plone).
- Specific GitHub Workflows are triggered based on changes in each codebase (refer to .github/workflows).
- Simplifies the creation of Docker images for each codebase.
- Demonstrates Plone installation/setup without buildout.

## Code quality assurance 🧐

To check your code against quality standards, run the following shell command.

```shell
make check
```

### Format the codebase

To format and rewrite the code base, ensuring it adheres to quality standards, run the following shell command.

```shell
make format
```

| Section | Tool | Description | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| backend | Ruff | Python code formatting, imports sorting  | [`backend/pyproject.toml`](./backend/pyproject.toml) |
| backend | `zpretty` | XML and ZCML formatting  | -- |

### Linting the codebase
or `lint`:

 ```shell
make lint
```

| Section | Tool | Description | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| backend | Ruff | Checks code formatting, imports sorting  | [`backend/pyproject.toml`](./backend/pyproject.toml) |
| backend | Pyroma | Checks Python package metadata  | -- |
| backend | check-python-versions | Checks Python version information  | -- |
| backend | `zpretty` | Checks XML and ZCML formatting  | -- |

## Internationalization 🌐

Generate translation files for Plone with ease:

```shell
make i18n
```
