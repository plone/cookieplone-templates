# Cookieplone Plone Project üåü

Welcome to **Cookieplone Plone Project**! Your one-stop solution to kickstart [Plone](https://plone.org/) 6 projects with ease and efficiency. Powered by [cookieplone](https://github.com/plone/cookieplone) and [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), this template is designed to save you time and ensure that you get started on the right foot. üöÄ

## Features ‚ú®

- Tailored for Plone 6
- Compatible with Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12

## Getting Started üèÅ

### Prerequisites

- **pipx**: A handy tool for installing and running Python applications.
- **NodeJS & pnpm**: Essential for managing and running JavaScript packages.


### Installation Guide üõ†Ô∏è

1. **pipx**

```shell
pip install pipx
```

2. **NodeJS & pnpm**

Follow the [Plone documentation](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/install-from-packages.html#pre-requisites-for-installation) for detailed instructions.


### Generate Your Plone 6 Project üéâ

```shell
pipx run cookieplone project
```

### Use options to avoid prompts

Cookieplone will ask a lot of questions.
You can use some of its options to avoid repeatedly entering the same values.


#### `--no_input`

You can use the [`--no_input`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli_options.html#cmdoption-cookiecutter-no-input) option to make cookieplone not prompt for parameters and only use `cookiecutter.json` file content.


#### `--replay` and `--replay-file`
You can use the option [`--replay-file`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli_options.html#cmdoption-cookiecutter-replay-file) to not prompt for parameters and only use information entered previously or from a specified file.
See [Replay Project Generation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/replay.html) in the cookiecutter documentation for more information.
