pip install {{ cookiecutter.python_package_name }}
```
And to create the Plone site:

```

## Add features using `plonecli` or `bobtemplates.plone`

This package provides plonecli/bobtemplates.plone compatible entrypoints to add all kind of subtemplates provided by them.

To use them, you need to use bobtemplates.plone version > X.X.X and run your command as follows:

```shell
plonecli add -b .mrbob.ini content_type
```

The command passes the `.mrbob.ini` configuration file to `plonecli` to set some configuration variables which are needed to properly run the subtemplates.
